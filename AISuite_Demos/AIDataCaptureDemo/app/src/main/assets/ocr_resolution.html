        The camera resolution is the number of pixels in the image captured by your
        device (e.g., 1MP = 1280x720, 8MP = 3840x2160). This affects the detail in
        the original photo before it&rsquo;s resized for AI processing.
        <strong
        >Higher resolution means more detail, helping read small, faint, or
            distant text&mdash;but also uses more processing power and memory. If
            speed, battery life, or memory use are your top priorities, low resolution
            can be a good choice for large or close-up text. Note:</strong
        >
        If the model input size is set low, using a high camera resolution
        won&rsquo;t improve results much, since the detailed image will be downscaled
        before processing.

    <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
        <li>
            <strong>Start with 2MP</strong> (1920x1080) resolution. This offers a good
            balance between image detail, speed, and battery use.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Increase to 4MP</strong> or 8MP only if you need to capture very
            small, faint, or distant text, and your device can handle the extra
            processing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Match your camera resolution to your model input size</strong>: If
            your model input size is 640x640, higher resolutions provide little
            benefit. For larger model input sizes (like 1280x1280 or 1600x1600), a
            higher resolution can help.

        <strong>at least 16 pixels tall</strong> in your image for reliable
