        The camera resolution is the number of pixels in the image captured by your
        device (e.g., 1MP = 1280x720, 8MP = 3840x2160). This affects the detail in
        the original photo before it&rsquo;s resized for AI processing.
        <strong
        >Higher resolution means more detail, helping read small, or distant
            barcodes&mdash;but also uses more processing power and memory.</strong
        >
        If speed, battery life, or memory use are your top priorities, low resolution
        can be a good choice for large or close-up barcodes.
        <strong>Note:</strong> If the model input size is set low, using a high
        camera resolution won&rsquo;t improve results much, since the detailed image
        will be downscaled before processing.

    <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
        <li>
            <strong>Start with 1 or 2MP.</strong> This offers a good balance between
            image detail, speed, and battery use.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Increase</strong> to 4MP or 8MP&nbsp;<strong>only if</strong> you
            need to capture very small, faint, or distant barcodes, and your device
            can handle the extra processing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Match your camera resolution to your model input size:</strong> If
            your model input size is 640x640, higher resolutions provide little
            benefit. For larger model input sizes (like 1280x1280 or 1600x1600), a
            higher resolution can help.

    <p>
        <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Make sure the barcode(s) you want to scan appears
        <strong>at least 8 pixels tall</strong> in your image for reliable
        recognition.
