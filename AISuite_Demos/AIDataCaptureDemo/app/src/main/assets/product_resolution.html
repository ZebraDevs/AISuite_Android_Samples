        The camera resolution is the number of pixels in the image captured by your
        device (e.g., 1MP = 1280x720). This affects the detail in the original photo
        before it&rsquo;s resized for AI processing.
        <strong
        >Higher resolution means more detail, helping read small, faint, or
            distant text&mdash;but also uses more processing power and memory. If
            speed, battery life, or memory use are your top priorities, low resolution
            can be a good choice for large or close-up text. Note:</strong
        >
        If the model input size is set low, using a high camera resolution
        won&rsquo;t improve results much, since the detailed image will be downscaled
        before processing.

    <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Start with 2MP</strong> (1920x1080) resolution. This offers a good
            balance between image detail, speed, and battery use.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Increase</strong> to 4MP if you need to capture very small, faint,
            distant product details, and your device can handle the extra processing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Match your camera resolution to your model input size:</strong> If
            your model input size is 640x640, higher resolutions provide little
            benefit. For larger model input sizes (like 1280x1280 or 1600x1600), a
            higher resolution can help.
        </li>
    </ul>

<div id="tip">
    <p>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure the resolution matches the increased level of
        product distinction required for your use case. is This is essential for
        distinguishing visually similar products, as it allows the model to capture
        details that low-resolution images might miss.
