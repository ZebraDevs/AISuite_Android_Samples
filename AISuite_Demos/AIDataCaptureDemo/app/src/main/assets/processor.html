        This setting chooses which chip in your device runs AI tasks, affecting speed
        and battery life. <br /><strong>Note:</strong> These models are designed to
        work the best with devices that have a DSP, on IOT Platforms, chipsets
        without a DSP will be slower. for details on compatible models, look for
        Zebra QC6490 and QC4490 mobile computers. see&nbsp;Zebra Platform Devices
