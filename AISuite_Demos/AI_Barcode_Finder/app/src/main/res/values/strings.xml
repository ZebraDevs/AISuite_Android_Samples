License and Ownership\n\n3.1 Subject to Licensee’s compliance with Section 4 of this Agreement, Zebra hereby grants Licensee a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to, during the Term, use the Software solely for Licensee’s internal business purposes and, for Software delivered with Zebra hardware, solely in support of Zebra hardware.\n\n3.2 If Zebra makes the Software available to Licensee as a Demo, Licensee shall limit use of the Software for the purpose of demonstrating features or capabilities of the Software so that Licensee can evaluate whether to obtain a full license to the Software.\n\n3.3 The Software is licensed; not sold. Zebra reserves all rights, title, and interest not expressly granted herein.\n</string>
    <string name="eula_screen_restrictions">4. Restrictions\n\n4.1 Licensee shall not or permit another to (i) modify, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or create derivative works of the Software; (ii) disassemble, decompile, reverse-engineer, or attempt to discover or derive source code of the Software, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this restriction; (iii) rent, sell, lease, lend, sublicense, provide commercial hosting services involving the Software, or in any other way allow third parties to exploit the Software; (iv) modify, circumvent, deactivate, degrade, or thwart any software-based or hardware-based protection mechanism Zebra has in place to safeguard the Software; (v) use, remove, alter, or obscure any of Zebra’s trademarks, trade names, logos, or service marks without prior written consent from Zebra; or (vi) embed any virus, Trojan horse, worm, backdoor, shutdown mechanism, malicious code, sniffer, bot, drop dead mechanism, or spyware or other software, code, or program that is likely to or is intended to have an adverse impact on the performance of, disable, corrupt, cause damage to, cause or facilitate unauthorized access to, or deny authorized access to any software, hardware, network, services, systems, data, or Zebra products.\n\n4.2 The rights granted to Licensee hereunder cannot be used or otherwise applied to anyone other than Licensee. Unless made through the sale of a device on which the Software is installed by or under the authorization of Zebra and subject to such third party’s acceptance of this Agreement, Licensee may not convey the Software to any third party or permit another to do so.\n\n4.3 Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without prior written consent from Zebra. Zebra may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations without Licensee’s consent. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to it and their respective legal representatives, successors, and permitted assigns.\n\n4.4 Unless Zebra has authorized Licensee or configured the Software to make the rights granted hereunder applicable to more than one device or transferable to a different device, the Software and the rights granted hereunder are specific to the original device on which the Software is first installed and activated (i.e., non-transferable) even if the original device is decommissioned, replaced, or otherwise no longer in use.\n\n4.5 “Sensitive Data” means any information that is protected under applicable data protection or privacy laws due to its sensitive nature, including government-issued identification numbers, financial account information, payment card data, personal health information (as defined in applicable legislation), biometric identifiers (as defined in applicable legislation), genetic data, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, union membership, sexual orientation, or any other data that, if disclosed or misused, could result in harm to an individual.

Updates, Support, and Fixes\n\n6.1 Nothing in this Agreement entitles Licensee to new releases, updates, maintenance, or technical support for the Software. Such entitlements must be obtained from Zebra through a separate purchase agreement, support agreement, or service contract, as available.\n\n6.2 If Zebra, at its discretion, makes updates, fixes, or patches to the Software available during the Term without providing superseding terms, this Agreement applies to such updates, fixes, and patches.\n\n6.3 Provided the functionality and features of the Software remain substantially similar thereafter, Zebra may automatically update the Software without requiring Licensee’s acceptance. Zebra will make reasonable efforts to provide (or instruct its resellers to provide) Licensee notice of automatic updates made to the Software, although such notice is not required under this Agreement.\n</string>
