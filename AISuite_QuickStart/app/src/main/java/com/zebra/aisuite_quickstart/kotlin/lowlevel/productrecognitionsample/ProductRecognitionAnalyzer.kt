/**
 * The ProductRecognitionAnalyzer class implements the ImageAnalysis.Analyzer interface and is
 * responsible for analyzing image frames to detect and recognize products. It integrates multiple
 * components including a Localizer for object detection, a FeatureExtractor for generating
 * descriptors, and a Recognizer for matching and identifying products.

 * This class is designed to be used within an Android application as part of a camera-based
 * product recognition solution. It processes image data asynchronously and returns recognition
 * results through a callback interface.

 * Usage:
 * - Instantiate the ProductRecognitionAnalyzer with the appropriate callback, localizer, feature extractor, and recognizer.
 * - Implement the DetectionCallback interface to handle recognition results.
 * - The analyze(ImageProxy) method is called by the camera framework to process image frames.
 * - Call stop() to terminate ongoing analysis and release resources.

 * Dependencies:
 * - Android ImageProxy: Provides access to image data from the camera.
 * - CoroutineScope: Used for asynchronous task execution, leveraging Kotlin coroutines.
 * - Localizer: Detects objects within an image.
 * - FeatureExtractor: Generates feature descriptors for detected objects.
 * - Recognizer: Matches feature descriptors to known products.

 * Concurrency:
 * - Uses a CoroutineScope to ensure that image analysis tasks are processed asynchronously.
 * - Manages concurrency with flags to control analysis state and prevent re-entry.

 * Note: Ensure that the appropriate permissions and dependencies are configured
 * in the AndroidManifest and build files to utilize camera and image processing capabilities.
